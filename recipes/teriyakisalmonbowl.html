    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    A teriyaki salmon bowl is a delicious and healthy dish that combines the 
    rich flavors of salmon with the sweet and savory notes of teriyaki sauce. 
    he salmon is typically marinated in a teriyaki mixture made from soy sauce, 
    mirin, sake, and sugar, then grilled or pan-seared to perfection. The glaze 
    caramelizes on the salmon, giving it a slightly crispy exterior while keeping 
    the fish tender and juicy inside. This dish is often served on a bed of fluffy 
    rice, absorbing the flavorful teriyaki sauce and making each bite satisfying.</p>

    <p>In addition to the salmon and rice, a teriyaki salmon bowl is commonly paired
    with a variety of fresh vegetables, such as steamed broccoli, edamame, or pickled
    ginger, adding color and texture to the dish. Sometimes, a sprinkling of sesame 
    seeds or a drizzle of extra teriyaki sauce enhances the flavors further. This Bowl
    is not only a visually appealing meal but also a balanced one, offering protein,
    carbs, and vitamins all in one bowl, making it a perfect choice for a nutritious 
    lunch or dinner.</p>
