    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish that is a staple in 
    Indian and South Asian cuisine, celebrated for its rich blend of spices and
    aromatic ingredients. The dish typically consists of marinated chicken,
    basmati rice, and a variety of spices such as saffron, cumin, cardamom,
    and cloves, which come together to create a complex and harmonious
    flavor profile. The chicken is often marinated in yogurt and spices, 
    which tenderizes the meat and infuses it with rich flavors. Layers of spiced 
    rice and marinated chicken are then cooked together, allowing the flavors to 
    meld beautifully. A garnish of fried onions, fresh herbs, and sometimes 
    hard-boiled eggs adds an extra touch of flavor and texture.</p>

    <p>The preparation of chicken biryani can be quite intricate, requiring careful 
    attention to ensure the rice is perfectly cooked while remaining light and 
    fluffy, and that the chicken stays tender and juicy. The dish is often cooked 
    using the "dum" method, where the pot is sealed tightly and the ingredients are 
    slow-cooked on low heat, allowing the steam to gently cook the layers. 
    This process ensures the flavors are deeply infused throughout the dish. 
    Chicken biryani is enjoyed with accompaniments like raita (yogurt-based condiment)
    , pickles, or a simple salad, making it a hearty and satisfying meal that's 
    popular at festive occasions and gatherings.</p>
